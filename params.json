Additionally, 1 in 5 people have difficulty using the internet. We have an opportunity to improve the UX of the products we design and build with some easy approaches and techniques. \r\n\r\n##What is this page?\r\n\r\nThis is just a collection of sites, articles, tutorials and readings I have collected that have helped me build better websites. Someone asked me to help them learn more about accessibility, and the first thought was to share the links I reference. This is a living page, please suggest more, edit what I post and help me grow this into a great resource of resources.\r\n\r\n##Resources\r\n\r\n* [Simple Introduction to Web Accessibility](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/simple-introduction-web-accessibility)\r\n* [Accessible Dialogs](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/02/12/making-an-accessible-dialog-box/)\r\n* [A11yproject.com](http://a11yproject.com)\r\n* [Simply Accessible](http://simplyaccessible.com/archives/)\r\n* [The Paciello Group](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/)\r\n* [My talk from Madison Ruby 2012](http://www.confreaks.com/presenters/719-greg-tarnoff)\r\n* [Accessibility and Developers by Paul Irish](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/accessibility-and-developers/)\r\n\r\n##Standards\r\n\r\n* [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria)\r\n* [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) - This should be your guideline for accessibility\r\n\r\n##Tools\r\n\r\n###Screen Readers\r\n\r\n* [NVDA for Windows](http://community.nvda-project.org/)\r\n* [JAWS for Windows](http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp)\r\n* [VoiceOver for Mac](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/) \r\n* [VoiceOver for iOS](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/)\r\n* [ChromeVox for Chrome/ChromeOS](http://www.chromevox.com/)\r\n\r\n###Accessibility Testing\r\n\r\n* [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/)\r\n* [Akbar Chrome Extension](http://howlowck.github.io/Akbar/)","google":"UA-20633229-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
