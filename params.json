{"name":"Accessibility Resources","tagline":"A collection of links and tools to help build accessible websites.","body":"#Why Accessibility?\r\n\r\nGood user experience (UX) starts with an accessible website. Additionally, 1 in 5 people have difficulty using the internet. We have an opportunity to improve the UX of the products we design and build with some easy approaches and techniques. \r\n\r\n##What is this page?\r\n\r\nThis is just a collection of sites, articles, tutorials and readings I have collected that have helped me build better websites. Someone asked me to help them learn more about accessibility, and the first thought was to share the links I reference. This is a living page, please suggest more, edit what I post and help me grow this into a great resource of resources.\r\n\r\n##How do you get started?\r\n\r\nIf you haven't built a website focused on accessibility in the past, get started can seem daunting. However, it's a lot easier than you think. Start with semantic HTML5. Make sure your classes describe the content of the container. Follow that with [Progressive Enhancement](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement) by making sure your site works as HTML, then add the CSS and finally the JavaScript to enhance behaviors. Be careful to not break default behavior to only go back in and fix it with JavaScript. This is the basis of any good, accessible site.\r\n\r\nFor more ideas how to make it even better, check out these links below.\r\n\r\n##Resources\r\n\r\n* [Simple Introduction to Web Accessibility](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/simple-introduction-web-accessibility)\r\n* [Accessible Dialogs](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/02/12/making-an-accessible-dialog-box/)\r\n* [A11yproject.com](http://a11yproject.com)\r\n* [Simply Accessible](http://simplyaccessible.com/archives/)\r\n* [The Paciello Group](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/)\r\n* [My talk from Madison Ruby 2012](http://www.confreaks.com/presenters/719-greg-tarnoff)\r\n* [Accessibility and Developers by Paul Irish](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/accessibility-and-developers/)\r\n\r\n##Standards\r\n\r\n* [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria)\r\n* [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) - This should be your guideline for accessibility\r\n\r\n##Tools\r\n\r\n###Screen Readers\r\n\r\n* [NVDA for Windows](http://community.nvda-project.org/)\r\n* [JAWS for Windows](http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp)\r\n* [VoiceOver for Mac](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/) \r\n* [VoiceOver for iOS](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/)\r\n* [ChromeVox for Chrome/ChromeOS](http://www.chromevox.com/)\r\n\r\n###Accessibility Testing\r\n\r\n* [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/)\r\n* [Akbar Chrome Extension](http://howlowck.github.io/Akbar/)","google":"UA-20633229-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
